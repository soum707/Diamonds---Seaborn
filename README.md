        <h1>Diamonds-Seaborn</h1>
        <p>This project utilizes the Diamonds dataset from Seaborn to predict diamond prices based on various given variables. Several machine learning models were implemented, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Random Forest.</p>
        <p>After thorough model validation, it was found that the Random Forest model outperformed the others, achieving a mean absolute error of approximately 260.</p>
        <p>Based on the analysis of variables, it was determined that the two most significant characteristics influencing diamond prices are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carat (weight of the diamond)</li>
            <li>Width (y-dimension of the diamond)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights provide valuable information for understanding the factors contributing to diamond pricing.</p>
